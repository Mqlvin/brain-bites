# Brain Bites
![brain-bites](res/logo.png)
<br>
Shorten long documentaries üìΩÔ∏è into short, education-packed videos ‚ö°.
<br>

## Usage / Running

To run the project, you will need the `openai` and `dotenv` Python libraries.<br>
You can either `pip install` them, or can install them otherwise appropriate to your operating system.<br>
<br>
You will also need `yt-dlp`, `ffplay` and `ffmpeg` available on your system's PATH, so it is executable from the terminal.<br>
<br>
The project will require an environment variable keystore (`.env` file) with the following keys:

- `OPENAI_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key.
- `RUNTIME_DIR` (optional) - The runtime directory, defaults to `./runtime`

<br>

## The Vision

The current project trajectory is to use AI and LLM to trim YouTube videos from lengthy documentaries into short and fast paced educational videos.<br>
This is to make videos more engaging and practical for usage, such as in a classroom, where time and attention spans are limited.<br>

The content is implemented in a frontend, scrolling-style web application.

<br>

## The Process

- We feed **OpenAI's GPT-4** with YouTube transcripts, asking the LLM to regenerate chapterized, concise transcript.<br>
- A comparison between the full and trimmed transcript will occur using a custom text-comparison algorithm, finding the removed sentences from the transcript.<br>
- The video will be split into chapters based on the shortened transcript using **ffmpeg**.<br>
- A quiz and chapter summaries are also generated to aid with learning, again using **OpenAI's GPT-4**.
- The content generated is served on-demand by the frontend

## Inversity

This is an [Inversity](https://inversity.co/) project application.<br>
We were tasked with "How can AI make education more engaging, effective and equitable?"
